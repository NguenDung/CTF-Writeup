# ðŸ“š CTF Writeup Repository

**Purpose**  
This repository is where I store all my CTF write-ups, from the very first basic challenges to more advanced ones in the future. Iâ€™ll keep it updated as I learn and explore.

**Directory Structure**  
- `OverTheWire/`   â€“ Write-ups from OverTheWire  
- `picoCTF/`       â€“ Write-ups from picoCTF  
- `TryHackMe/`     â€“ Write-ups from TryHackMe  
- `HackTheBox/`    â€“ Write-ups from Hack The Box  
- `Other/`         â€“ Miscellaneous challenges (contests, blog exercises, etc.)

Kinda i will divide my writeup base on this structure for easier management :D

**How to Use**  
1. Browse into the folder for the platform or contest youâ€™re interested in  
2. Each challenge has its own subfolder containing a `writeups-files` and one more for the corresponding code or downloaded assets.  
3. Each write-up follows this structure:  
   - **Category** (pwn / web / crypto / â€¦)  
   - **Overview & Approach**  
   - **Step-by-Step Solution**  
   - **Flag**
